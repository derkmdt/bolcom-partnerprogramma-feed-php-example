# bolcom-partnerprogramma-feed-php-example
Example php code for interpreting the product-feed

This example shows how the product feed can be read with PHP.

example: "php -f src/LoadXml.php"

This example makes use of XMLReader since the product feeds are pretty large.

For running the tests: "phpunit Tests/"

In the resources folder the XSD files can be found. Product-feed-1.0.xsd is the starting point there (which wraps the product-1.0.xsd).
